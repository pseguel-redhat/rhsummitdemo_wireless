# GitOps your distributed Edge with Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform - Networking

Red Hat Summit 2022 - BS1288

## Repo objective

This repo is an example of a NetGitOps implementation with Ansible. 
The idea is using files that describe the current state of the networking infrastructure, and using Git as a single source of truth. 

In this case, the file `wireless.yml` represents the state of the wireless network.
